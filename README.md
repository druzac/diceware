# requirements

The rust toolchain is required. Instructions for installing it are
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

# go

This builds and runs in debug mode:

    cargo build
	cargo -- run 6

The program is simple enough that compiling optimized code by
using the `--release` flag shouldn't be necessary.
